Two sets of analysis code are provided, one which implements the analyses using
the multinma R package, and another which calls Stan models directly. We 
recommend following the multinma scripts for most analysis purposes; the 
latter may be useful for those wishing to further modify the models beyond the
level of customisation offered by the multinma package.


## Analyses using multinma

The folder `multinma` contains R code to recreate the analyses in the
paper using the multinma R package:

 * `multinma/simulated_parametric_survival.R` recreates the simulated example,
   fitting parametric proportional hazards models to data simulated from a 
   Weibull distribution.

 * `multinma/ndmm_survival.R` recreates the newly diagnosed multiple myeloma 
   example, fitting models with a flexible M-spline baseline hazard. Synthetic 
   data are included in the multinma R package.


## Analyses using Stan directly

The folder `rstan` contains R code to recreate the analyses in the
paper, setting up and calling Stan models directly via the rstan package:

 * `rstan/simulated_parametric_survival.R` recreates the simulated example,
   fitting parametric proportional hazards models to data simulated from a 
   Weibull distribution. The corresponding Stan code is found in
   `rstan/survival_param.stan`.

 * `rstan/ndmm_survival.R` recreates the newly diagnosed multiple myeloma 
   example, fitting models with a flexible M-spline baseline hazard. Synthetic
   data are constructed from the summary information in the folder `ndmm_data`.
   The corresponding Stan code is found in `rstan/survival_mspline.stan`.
